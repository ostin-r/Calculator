# Calculator
A simple calculator for my first GUI project

As an engineer, GUIs have always scared me.  The closest I ever got to making a GUI in engineering school was a simple print statement for the solution to whatever problem I happened to be solving.  I originally planned to do this project on my own first and then check a professional solution, but I got stuck at too many points to make that a reality.  Instead, I just plan on following along the video from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXPyB4XeYLA&t=4126s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) and posting my progress.  Here goes nothing.

Project Completion Update 1/13/21:

Overall this was a really fun project.  I got a basic calculator up and running thanks to the help of videos from freeCodeCamp.org, and I branched off afterwords and made my own calculator with a few more features.  My final result is a themed calculator that can do all basic functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide), change the sign of the user's input, and handle decimal values.

Wrestling with a couple new packages were my favorite learning hurdles from this project.  Learning about tkinter was a blast, and I feel learning it has really connected me to the basics of GUI design.  I also got to learn about ttkthemes and how it worked.  I really got into the code on this one to figure out how it works.  A big thanks to Red Fantom for [ttkthemes](https://github.com/TkinterEP/ttkthemes) which made my final calculator much more pleasing to the eye.

As with all of my projects, I'll call this one finished.  However, I will leave it open to changes as there are many features I could add to make it truly useful.  Cheers!
