# Calculator
A simple calculator for my first GUI project

As an engineer, GUIs have always scared me.  The closest I ever got to making a GUI in engineering school was a simple print statement for the solution to whatever problem I happened to be solving.  I originally planned to do this project on my own first and then check a professional solution, but I got stuck at too many points to make that a reality.  Instead, I just plan on following along the video from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXPyB4XeYLA&t=4126s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) and posting my progress.  Here goes nothing.
